## Features

### Listening
- **Menu-bar widget** — lives in the menu bar, no Dock icon.
- **YouTube audio** — paste any URL or video ID, or pick from the built-in Discover catalog (lofi, synthwave, jazz, classical, electronic).
- **YouTube playlists** — paste any `&list=PL…` URL and Murmur enumerates the items via the Data API, follows auto-advance, and shows track index in the header. Mix playlists (`RD…`) play but can't auto-advance — the app warns you.
- **YouTube search** — built-in search sheet for videos, trending (regional), and channels. Browse a channel's recent uploads. Recent searches and recently-played videos are tracked.
- **Trending tab** — regional picker, optional auto-fill into the playback queue when it empties.
- **Playback queue** — "Play next" / "Add to queue" from any search result or history row; reorderable, persisted.
- **Local playlists** — create / rename / delete / reorder named playlists. Right-click any video → "Add to: My Mix". Lives entirely on your Mac (UserDefaults), nothing pushed to your YouTube account.
- **Favorites** — save the current stream and the active item gets marked in the ★ menu.
- **Playback rate** — 0.5× to 2.0× via a small menu next to the volume slider.

### Window
- **Chromeless floating video** — optional 16:9 window with no title bar, draggable from anywhere, always-on-top, aspect-ratio-locked.
- **HUD overlay** — fades in on hover: play/pause, scrub, time, volume, **pin**, close.
- **Pin to all Spaces** — pinning toggles `.canJoinAllSpaces` so the video follows you across Mission Control desktops and into full-screen apps. Persists across launches.
- **Cassette tape UI** — animated reels with play/pause inside the cassette; the cassette's label carries the now-playing title + playlist context; rotation speed tied to volume.
- **Smart loading** — opaque mask hides any flash between stream switches, and an in-page cover masks YouTube's paused-state overlay (Topic-channel "now playing" card, center pills) — so the floating window only ever shows the video itself.

### Sharing & updates
- **Share menu** in the popover — system share sheet via `ShareLink`, plus copy actions for: YouTube link, Murmur deep link, title, title + link, rich "now playing" card.
- **`murmur://` URL scheme** — `murmur://play?v=<id>[&list=<playlistID>]`. Recipients with Murmur installed open straight into playback.
- **In-app update notifications** — the version label in the footer flips into a tappable accent badge when a newer release is published. Background check runs on launch + every 6 hours against GitHub Releases.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools (Swift 5.9+) — install with:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- **Optional:** a YouTube Data API v3 key for search / trending / playlist enumeration. The gear icon in the popover walks you through adding one.

Recipients of a shared `.app` only need macOS 13+ — no Swift toolchain.

## Quick start

### Run locally

```bash
swift run -c release
```

First build takes ~15–20 seconds; subsequent launches are instant.

> The dev binary reports its version as `dev` and skips the update check.

### Build a shareable `.app`

```bash
./build-app.sh
```

Produces:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/Murmur.app` | Double-clickable app |
| `dist/Murmur.zip` | Send this to others (~1.4 MB zipped) |

Optional flags:

- `--no-sign` — skip ad-hoc codesign (default is **on**; turning it off will produce a binary Apple Silicon refuses to launch)
- `--open` — open the `dist/` folder in Finder when done

### Sharing

1. Send `dist/Murmur.zip`.
2. Recipient unzips.
3. First launch: **right-click → Open → Open** in the Gatekeeper warning. After that, normal double-click works forever.
4. Optional: drag `Murmur.app` into `/Applications`.

If Gatekeeper says "app is damaged":

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Murmur.app
```

### Publishing a new release

1. Bump `VERSION` in [`build-app.sh`](build-app.sh).
2. `./build-app.sh` to build + zip.
3. Commit, then tag with the **`v` prefix** (matching the existing release history):
   ```bash
   git tag v2026.05.20.5
   git push origin main v2026.05.20.5
   ```
4. Publish the release with the bundled zip:
   ```bash
   gh release create v2026.05.20.5 \
     --latest --title "v2026.05.20.5 — …" \
     --notes "…" dist/Murmur.zip
   ```

Anyone running an older build sees the update badge within 6 hours of their next launch.

## Customizing

### Default stream

Edit [`Sources/Murmur/main.swift`](Sources/Murmur/main.swift):

```swift
let kDefaultVideoID = "YmQ7jRgf4f0"
```

Replace with any YouTube video ID (the part after `v=`). Rebuild.

### Discover catalog

Edit the `catalog` array near the bottom of [`Sources/Murmur/ContentView.swift`](Sources/Murmur/ContentView.swift). Add categories or items — they'll appear in the ★ menu under "Discover live music".

### App icon

The icon is generated from a Swift script so it stays in sync with the in-app palette:

```bash
swift make-icon.swift
```

That regenerates `icon.png`. Then `./build-app.sh` rebakes the `.icns` into the bundle.

### Update-check endpoint

`UpdateChecker.releasesAPI` in [`Sources/Murmur/Ambient/UpdateChecker.swift`](Sources/Murmur/Ambient/UpdateChecker.swift) points to the GitHub Releases API for this fork. If you fork the project, update that constant.

```

### How it works

- An `NSStatusItem` lives in the menu bar and opens an `NSPopover` (behavior `.applicationDefined` + a global `NSEvent` monitor for click-outside-to-close — `.transient` causes SwiftUI Menu hover flicker).
- A `WKWebView` hosts the YouTube embed iframe and lives in a real `NSWindow` (off-screen by default) so WebKit doesn't suspend media playback.
- Toggling the video on changes the window's `styleMask` to a chromeless `[.titled, .closable, .resizable, .fullSizeContentView]` floating window. Pinning flips `collectionBehavior` to `[.canJoinAllSpaces, .stationary, .fullScreenAuxiliary]` so the window joins every Space.
- A transparent `WindowDragOverlay` on top of the WKWebView calls `window.performDrag(with:)` so the entire video surface drags the window — `isMovableByWindowBackground` alone is unreliable when stacked over WebKit.
- Swift ↔ iframe communication uses the YouTube IFrame API's postMessage protocol, with state and title posted back via `webkit.messageHandlers`.
- Stream switches trigger a Swift-side opaque mask **and** an in-page JS cover, so neither the WKWebView reload flash nor YouTube's paused/branding overlays are ever visible.
- `playNext` / `playPrev` / `onEnded` honor (in order): active YouTube playlist → active user playlist → playback queue → trending auto-fill.
- `murmur://` deep links are registered in `Info.plist`'s `CFBundleURLTypes` (added by `build-app.sh`) and handled by `AppDelegate.application(_:open:)`.

## Notes

- Live streams require an internet connection.
- Closing the floating video window only hides it — audio keeps playing. Use the **Quit** button in the popover footer to fully exit.
- Drag from anywhere on the video to move the window.
- The app runs as `LSUIElement` (no Dock icon), so there's no app menu — Quit is in the popover.
- The `murmur://` URL scheme only works in the built `.app` (`swift run` doesn't load `Info.plist`).
